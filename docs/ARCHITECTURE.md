# Architecture

This document explains how FilaMind Flow is put together and why. For a quick
start see the root [README](../README.md).

## Goals

1. **Integrate** with Klipper, Moonraker, Mainsail, and Fluidd without forking any
   of them.
2. **Stay light** on the printer host.
3. **Grow** through small, independent features.

## Integration model

The panel is a standalone SPA that talks **directly to Moonraker** and is linked
from the Mainsail sidebar (Fluidd has no custom-link API yet, so it is reached by
URL there). This is the same pattern other ecosystem tools use: there is no stable
third-party plugin API inside Mainsail/Fluidd, so a sibling page sharing the same
Moonraker instance is the clean, durable approach.

```

  └─ FilaMind Flow SPA ──REST──► Moonraker :7125 ──► Klipper (MCU)
                       └──WS───► Moonraker :7125
  └─ FilaMind Flow SPA ──REST──► FilaMind backend :8000 ──► Moonraker (server-side)
```

## Resource footprint

- **Frontend** is built on a developer machine and deployed as static files
  served by nginx (the same web server that already serves Mainsail/Fluidd). At
  runtime the printer host only serves a few static assets; the browser on the
  client device executes the app. Cost on the Pi ≈ that of serving static files.
- **Backend** is a single async Uvicorn process: idle ≈ 30–60 MB RAM and ~0% CPU,
  comparable to Moonraker's own footprint. It is event-driven — no polling loops.
- **WebSocket** subscriptions are limited to the union of the printer objects the
  active widgets actually need, keeping notification traffic minimal.

## Frontend layers

```
src/
├─ core/
│  ├─ moonraker/   # transport: reconnecting JSON-RPC WS client + types + config
│  ├─ registry/    # extensibility: the widget registry
│  ├─ store/       # state: Pinia mirror of Moonraker status
│  └─ i18n.ts      # i18n: catalog loading, locale detection, switching
├─ components/     # presentation: app shell + dashboard (design-system driven)
├─ widgets/        # features: self-registering widgets (Firmware Manager · Input Shaping · Motor Drivers · Config Editor · Macro Designer · Board Topology · Max-Flow · Config Templates · Hardware Browser)
├─ locales/        # i18n message catalogs, one folder per language (en bundled; others lazy)
└─ assets/styles/  # Neo-Brutalist design tokens + component classes
```

Dependencies point inward: `widgets` and `components` depend on `core`; `core`
depends on nothing app-specific. This keeps the transport and registry reusable
and testable in isolation.

### MoonrakerClient

A single long-lived client (`core/moonraker/client.ts`) owns the WebSocket:

- **Request/response** — each `call()` gets an incrementing id; responses resolve
  the matching pending promise, with a timeout safety net.
- **Notifications** — `notify_*` messages are fanned out to listeners registered
  by method name (e.g. the store listens for `notify_status_update`).
- **Reconnection** — exponential backoff; on reconnect the remembered subscription
  set is re-sent so widgets keep receiving updates transparently.

### Widget lifecycle

1. At startup, `registerWidgets()` calls `registerWidget(...)` for each feature.
2. On connect, the store subscribes to `widgetRegistry.aggregateSubscriptions()`
   — the merged set of every widget's required printer objects — in one call.
3. `notify_status_update` deltas are shallow-merged into the reactive store.
4. The dashboard renders each registered widget inside a Neo-Brutalist frame;
   widgets read from the store and send commands through the shared client.

Because widgets declare their data needs and render from shared state, adding a
feature never requires touching the transport or other widgets.

## Backend

A FastAPI application factory (`create_app`) wires settings, logging, CORS, and a
versioned `/api` router. It exposes liveness (`/api/health`), a server-side
Moonraker reachability probe (`/api/moonraker/status`), the **firmware**
build / flash / device routes (`/api/firmware/*`), the **input-shaping**
resonance-analysis routes (`/api/shaper/*` — which vendor Klipper's
`shaper_calibrate` and add pure-numpy resonance analyses: axes-map,
spectrogram, and the machine vibrations profile), and the **motor-drivers**
routes (`/api/drivers/status` — TMC driver state aggregated from the live config +
per-driver `get_status`, annotated from a curated capability catalog
(`app/data/driver_catalog.json`) and the user's saved motor assignment;
`/api/drivers/live/{stepper}` — fast per-driver live telemetry for the monitor;
`/api/drivers/catalog` — that capability map; `/api/drivers/motors` — a 200+ motor
database baked to `app/data/motor_catalog.json`; `/api/drivers/mapping` — the persisted
stepper→motor map; `/api/drivers/recommend` — a run-current + register recommendation from
a built-in `motor_constants` physics model;
`/api/drivers/{config-block,apply,init,autotune,stallguard,home}` — copy-to-config and the
gated live `SET_TMC_*` / `INIT_TMC` / `AUTOTUNE_TMC` writes + sensorless-homing threshold and
test-home, all refused while printing), and the **config** routes (`/api/config/files`,
`/api/config/file` — list and parse the live `printer.cfg` and its includes through the
round-trip `klipper_config` engine into sections → params + validation issues; read-only,
the keystone of the planned Config Editor). It is the right home for
operations that should not run in the browser — privileged file or system actions,
the live `ACCELEROMETER_MEASURE` / `TEST_RESONANCES` capture orchestration,
multi-call aggregations, or scheduled jobs — added as new route modules under
`app/api/routes/`.

### Hardware database (`/api/hardware/*`)

A curated, **read-only** reference dataset — `app/data/reference/hardware.json` (~7.5 MB)
loaded **once at import** into a module-global dict (`reference_data.py`) and immutable
thereafter (handlers only read; no locks). The raw rows (`items[]`) are deduped/enriched at
build time into **canonical entity arrays** — `boards`, `drivers`, `motors`, `hosts`, and a generic
`catalog` (9 more categories) — each entity carrying its specs **plus a copyable Klipper config
snippet** (a board pin-map, a `[tmcXXXX]` driver block, a recommended motor `run_current`, an
`[mcu host]` block, etc.). Per type there is a small `*_search.py` (filter + paginate to lightweight
summaries) and two routes: a paginated list and a `/{id}` full record. A `manufacturers` directory
and `categories` round it out. CI guards keep it honest (per-category floors so a regen can't gut a
category; a scrub check for external-project names; lossless port-aggregation locks).

**Performance (DB-1):** lists, `id→entity` index dicts and a precomputed per-item search haystack
are built once at load, so every `*_by_id` is O(1) and the flat free-text search never rebuilds its
haystacks per request; the read-only `/api/hardware/*` responses carry a weak `ETag` + `Cache-Control`
(304 on a match, busting on redeploy).

**Linking backbone (DB-2):** `hardware_links.py` (a pure module) turns the formerly-islanded
relationships into a precomputed in-memory graph, built once at load. It canonicalises
**manufacturers** (a stable `manufacturer_id` + auto-derived aliases — variant spellings collapse to
one id — with junk/placeholders excluded), promotes the **MCU** to a first-class entity (board
`specs.MCU` parsed via a chip-family whitelist → canonical part), and builds an adjacency map keyed by
composite `<type>:<id>` ids (ids are *not* unique across types — `sovol-sv08` is both a board and a
host). That powers `GET /api/hardware/manufacturers[/{id}]`, `/mcus[/{id}]`, a generic
`GET /api/hardware/{type}/{id}/related`, and `?expand=related` on the detail routes — all O(1) — so a
widget can pull an entity *and everything related to it* in one call. A CI edge-validator proves the
graph has no dangling edges. The Hardware Browser **surfaces** this graph (DB-3a): every entity's
detail shows clickable **cross-link chips** (manufacturer / MCU / drivers) that deep-link to the
related entity, and **Brands** / **MCUs** tabs let you browse from a maker or a chip outward. The five
detail panels share one `EntityCatalog.vue` shell (search / list / pagination / expand / copy /
deep-link), each a thin wrapper supplying a `fetchPage` closure + bespoke summary/detail slots (DB-3b).
See the Hardware-DB section in [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).

## Design system

Neo-Brutalism, expressed as Tailwind tokens (`frontend/tailwind.config.ts`) and a
few component classes (`frontend/src/assets/styles/main.css`):

- **Color** — warm paper background, ink (`#111`) foreground, saturated flat
  accents (yellow/pink/cyan/lime).
- **Borders** — thick (`3px`) ink borders, near-sharp corners.
- **Shadows** — hard, blur-free offsets (`4px 4px 0 #111`); buttons "press" by
  shrinking the shadow and translating on `:active`.
- **Type** — a chunky display face (Space Grotesk) with monospace (JetBrains
  Mono) for data.

### Theming

Every visual token is a **CSS custom property**, so the whole app restyles from a single switch.
The Tailwind tokens reference the variables (`ink: 'rgb(var(--c-ink) / <alpha-value>)'`, `boxShadow`
→ `var(--nb-shadow*)`, `borderRadius.brutal` → `var(--nb-radius)`), so **every existing utility**
(`bg-paper`, `border-ink`, `bg-brand-cyan`, `shadow-brutal`, `rounded-brutal`) recolors per theme with
no component edits. `main.css` holds `:root` (Light defaults) plus a `[data-theme="…"]` block per theme.

- **Themes:** `neon` (default — deep violet + soft glow + rounded), `dark` (neutral charcoal), `light`
  (the original brutalist look), `contrast` (near-black/white, a11y). Mirrors the i18n design:
  `core/theme.ts` (registry + detect + `localStorage` persistence + reactive `data-theme`), a
  `ThemeSelect` header control, and a no-flash inline `<head>` script that applies the saved theme
  before first paint. **Adding a theme = one `[data-theme]` block + a `THEME_META` entry + locale names.**
- Theme is **orthogonal to locale/RTL** — the `:lang(ar)`/`[dir=rtl]` rules are independent.
- SVG charts read the same token variables (not hardcoded hex), so they recolor with the theme.

### Offline note

Fonts currently load from Google Fonts with system fallbacks, so an offline host
still renders (in fallback faces). For a fully offline install, self-host the two
fonts and replace the `<link>` in `index.html` with local `@font-face` rules.

## Internationalization (i18n)

`vue-i18n` v11 (Composition API), set up in `src/core/i18n.ts` and registered in `main.ts`. The
design mirrors the rest of the app: offline-first, extensible, and type-safe.

- **Offline-first.** `en` is bundled eagerly so first paint never waits on a network fetch (a
  printer host is usually offline). Every other locale is a dynamic `import()` chunk loaded on
  switch — combined with each widget's `defineAsyncComponent` chunk, switching to Arabic and
  opening one widget downloads only that locale's catalog for that widget.
- **Namespaced catalogs** under `src/locales/<code>/` mirror the code-split: `common`, `shell`, and
  one per widget (`firmware`, `input-shaping`, `motor-drivers`, `config-editor`, `macro-designer`,
  `board-topology`, `max-flow`, `config-templates`, `hardware-browser`). Each JSON file carries a single
  top-level namespace key (e.g. `shell`) that is merged into the locale's messages.
- **Drop-in extensibility.** `availableLocales` is derived from which catalog folders exist, so a
  new language is *dropping in `src/locales/<code>/`* — no component or registry edits. The switcher
  (`LanguageSelect`, reusing `ComboSelect`) appears once more than one locale ships.
- **Type-safe keys.** `en` is the single source of truth; `src/types/i18n.d.ts` augments vue-i18n's
  `DefineLocaleMessage` from the `en` catalog, so `t('…')` is autocompleted and a wrong key fails
  `type-check`. Other locales are checked **structurally** against `en` by `scripts/i18n-keydiff.mjs`
  (a CI gate) — keys are often built dynamically (e.g. `t('inputShaping.grade.verdict.' + letter)`),
  which defeats eslint's `no-unused-keys`.
- **Numbers, dates, direction.** Per-locale `numberFormats` / `datetimeFormats` route values through
  `Intl` (locale separators / digit system) instead of `.toFixed()` string-gluing. Arabic pins
  Western digits (`numberingSystem: 'latn'`) — engineers cross-reference G-code and datasheets in
  `1.7 A` form. `<html lang>` / `dir` are set reactively from the active locale's metadata, so RTL
  flips with the language.
- **Tooling.** `npm run i18n:keydiff` (key-set parity, in CI) and `npm run i18n:pseudo`
  (pseudo-localization — accents + ~40% padding + brackets — to surface text-expansion / RTL overflow
  and any un-externalized strings before a translator is involved).
- **Backend messages.** Write endpoints return a `{ code, params, message }` contract: the backend
  picks a stable `code` (e.g. `motorDrivers.apply.applied`) plus interpolation `params`, and keeps an
  English `message` as a fallback. The UI renders `t(code, params)` (`applyResultText`) so localized
  copy lives in the frontend catalog, not the server. Raw upstream / validation errors (Moonraker
  failures, `field_policy` text) carry **no** `code` and surface their English text verbatim — they
  are technical strings, not product copy.

SI **unit symbols** (Hz, A, °C, Ω, Nm, mH, mm/s²) and brand / protocol / register / G-code tokens
stay Latin in every locale; only the surrounding plain-language copy is translated. All six i18n
phases (scaffolding → widgets → RTL/Arabic → backend message codes) are complete (see
[ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md)).

## Conventions

- Frontend: TypeScript, Prettier (no semicolons, single quotes, width 100),
  ESLint flat config, `<script setup>` SFCs.
- Backend: type hints everywhere, Ruff (lint + format), Mypy, Pydantic v2 models.
