# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Firmware version tracking (Phase 6)** — FilaMind now captures the Klipper
  version / commit / date a profile is built with (`<profile>.build_info.json`
  via `get_klipper_version`) and records what it flashes to each board
  (`flashed.json`). The **Linux host MCU** and other boards now show their
  firmware version even when Moonraker can't report it (e.g. an unconfigured
  host MCU) — and each profile carries its `built_version`. Closes the
  version-display gap found against KlipperFleet.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- The **Linux host MCU** flash now matches the standard install: stop
  `klipper-mcu`, free the binary with `fuser -k`, install it executable, restart
  the service, and wait for it to come up — warning (instead of leaving it
  silently broken) if the kernel blocks realtime, in which case the `-r` flag
  should be dropped from the klipper-mcu unit. `setup-sudoers.sh` now also grants
  `fuser`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Live MCU telemetry** in the firmware status — each MCU now shows its actual
  clock frequency, awake load, and retransmitted-bytes count (the key host↔MCU
  comms-health signal, highlighted when non-zero), pulled from the MCU's
  `last_stats`. First of the Firmware Upgrade widget's planned enhancements.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-05-31

### Fixed

- The flash readiness probe ran `sudo -n true`, which never matches the narrow
  sudoers rule, so flashing kept reporting "blocked" even after running
  `setup-sudoers.sh`. It now probes an allowed command (`systemctl --version`).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `deploy/setup-sudoers.sh` — grants the backend the narrow passwordless-sudo
  rights flashing needs (`systemctl`, `dfu-util`, `cp`, `chmod`). Run once with
  sudo to enable the Flash phase; until then the UI reports flashing as blocked
  and points to this script.

### Fixed

- Flash now stops/starts the correct service (`klipper-mcu` for a Linux-process
  MCU, `klipper` for hardware MCUs) and marks an installed Linux MCU binary
  executable.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Firmware flash (Phase 5 — Flash)**: push a built artifact onto a board from
  the browser. `POST /api/firmware/flash` runs the right tool for the board —
  Katapult `flashtool.py` (serial / CAN), `dfu-util` (DFU), or `make flash`
  (AVR) — rebooting it to its bootloader first, and streams the log. A read-only
  `POST /api/firmware/flash-plan` previews the exact command + safety gates.
  Flashing is **refused while a print is running**, requires a built artifact,
  and needs passwordless sudo; the UI shows the plan, warnings, and a hard
  confirmation before anything touches the board. Completes the widget's
  configure → build → flash pipeline.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Firmware build (Phase 4 — Build)**: compile a saved profile into a flashable
  artifact from the browser. `GET /api/firmware/build/{profile}` stages the
  profile's `.config`, runs `make clean` + `make olddefconfig` + `make`, and
  **streams the build log live** (with stall / total timeouts); the resulting
  `out/klipper.{bin,uf2,elf}` is copied into the artifacts directory under the
  profile name. The Configure view gains a **build** button per profile, a live
  log console, and a **built ✓** indicator.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Firmware config editor (Phase 3 — Configure)**: edit Klipper's
  `make menuconfig` options from the browser. The backend loads Klipper's bundled
  `kconfiglib`, serialises `src/Kconfig` into a live menu tree (dependencies
  re-evaluate as values change), and writes a `.config`. Edits are saved as
  **per-board profiles** (one `.config` each) under the FilaMind data dir, with
  list / save / delete via `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE /api/firmware/config/...`. The
  widget gains a **Configure firmware** view that renders the tree as a form with
  a profile selector. Adds a `kconfiglib` dependency (Klipper's own copy is
  preferred at runtime).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Board discovery** (`GET /api/firmware/boards`) — finds every flashable MCU on
  any printer by merging four independent sources: configured `[mcu]` sections
  from Moonraker, USB/serial (`/dev/serial/by-id` + ttyACM/ttyUSB), CAN (Katapult
  `flashtool.py -q` on each CAN interface), and DFU (`dfu-util -l`). Each board
  reports its connection (usb/can/dfu/linux), mode (service / ready / dfu),
  whether it is configured, and its running firmware version. Surfaced as a
  **Detected boards** section in the Firmware Upgrade widget.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Firmware Upgrade widget now surfaces the optional **Linux host MCU** (Klipper
  "Linux process" MCU) explicitly — `active` / `available · not configured` /
  `not installed` — based on the host's `klipper-mcu` service and whether a host
  MCU is wired into the running config. Each MCU row also shows its connection
  kind (host / canbus / usb / serial).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-31

### Changed

- Firmware Upgrade widget: the **host** is now shown as a first-class row in the
  device list — the reference version every MCU is compared against — styled
  distinctly instead of a separate header line.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- **Firmware Upgrade widget — Phase 1**: read-only firmware status showing each
  MCU's version, host↔MCU sync detection, and toolchain readiness
  (`GET /api/firmware/status`). The first FilaMind widget.
- A living [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).
- Dev test harness (`dev/virtual-printer/`): develop against any Moonraker through
  the Vite dev proxy via `MOONRAKER_PROXY_TARGET` (strips the browser Origin, so no
  printer CORS changes are needed) — plus an optional Docker simulated printer.
- Verified the full on-device deployment on a real **BigTreeTech CB1**: backend
  systemd service + nginx-served UI + a **FilaMind Flow entry in the Mainsail
  sidebar** (alongside KlipperFleet), with klippy `ready` and a live Connected badge.

### Changed

- The frontend now defaults to **same-origin** endpoints (it is served behind a
  proxy that forwards Moonraker/backend traffic) instead of `host:7125`, so no host
  or port is baked into the build and there is no CORS.
- The deploy nginx template strips `Origin` on the Moonraker proxy.
- Relicensed from MIT to **GPL-3.0-or-later** to match the Klipper / Moonraker ecosystem.
- Header now has a **Back to Mainsail** button.

### Fixed

- Backend `cors_origins` raised a `SettingsError` when set from the environment; it
  is now a comma-separated string exposed as `cors_origin_list`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Project scaffold (empty, no feature widgets yet).
- Frontend: Vue 3 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS with a Neo-Brutalist design
  system (tokens + `nb-card` / `nb-btn` / `nb-badge` components).
- `MoonrakerClient`: reconnecting JSON-RPC WebSocket client with request
  correlation, notification fan-out, and automatic subscription restoration.
- Widget registry (extensibility core) + Pinia printer store + app shell
  (sidebar, header, live connection status, empty-state dashboard).
- Backend: FastAPI service with health and Moonraker reachability endpoints,
  settings via `pydantic-settings`, and a server-side Moonraker HTTP client.
- Tooling: ESLint (flat) + Prettier + Vitest; Ruff + Mypy + Pytest; GitHub
  Actions CI; deployment templates (systemd, nginx, Moonraker update_manager,
  Mainsail navi).
